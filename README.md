# G-Club
A Direct Pathway to Participate in the Rural Economy of the Amazon Rainforest
The Official G Club
Connect people all over the world in deep and meaningful ways by offering the chance of participating in the (bio)economy of the Amazon Rainforest.

Create a new trend that gives a 100% positive match when it comes to protect the rainforest. The key is to collaborate with the Rainforest populations, the only ones that can truly help to protect the Amazon.

Ensure a meaningful, life-changing and transparent contribution by using utilizing blockchain protocols to disrupt and reinvent a new way to structure the native Amazonian crops supply chain that have been built on exploitation and deceptive trade practices

How It Works
We are buiding an initial Impact and Art NFT Collection which, when purchased, act as the entrance to the G Club membership.
The inaugural piece in a groundbreaking NFT art collection meticulously crafted to immortalize the diverse cultures thriving within the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. This mesmerizing digital artwork encapsulates the spirit, traditions, and resilience of the Rainforest's peoples, serving as a poignant testament to their harmonious coexistence with nature.

What sets "Rainforest Unveiled" apart is its profound impact in the territory. A remarkable 80% of the proceeds generated from this NFT will be directed towards a local rural community nestled in the Amazon, empowering them to preserve their heritage and sustainably manage their environment.

As a token of gratitude for your support, the acquisition of "Rainforest Unveiled" also grants you an exclusive membership to the G Club. This membership unlocks a multitude of benefits, offering you privileged access to the Rainforest Online Boutique, GREEN-C. Immerse yourself in ethically sourced, eco-friendly products, allowing you to make a tangible contribution to the preservation of the Amazon while enjoying the finest offerings from this enchanting realm.

By embracing "Roots Unveiled" and becoming a G Club member, you not only gain ownership of a unique digital masterpiece but actively participate in the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest and its extraordinary communities.

We are now planning to develop this MVP further by building it on Celo. 
At the same time we are putting together a strategy for community development, targeting our own customers at Green-C Boutique which have an extra-care for the Environment. The more customers we manage to enter the G Club, the more transaction we will provide on Celo, and the more resources we can direct to the rural communities in the Amazon Rainforest that act as our colaborators and vendors.
