# G-Club
A Direct Pathway to Participate in the Rural Economy of the Amazon Rainforest
The Official G Club
Connect people all over the world in deep and meaningful ways by offering the chance of participating in the (bio)economy of the Amazon Rainforest.

Create a new trend that gives a 100% positive match when it comes to protect the rainforest. The key is to collaborate with the Rainforest populations, the only ones that can truly help to protect the Amazon.

Ensure a meaningful, life-changing and transparent contribution by using utilizing blockchain protocols to disrupt and reinvent a new way to structure the native Amazonian crops supply chain that have been built on exploitation and deceptive trade practices
